# Bridging-Silence-through-American-Sign-Language
ASL is a critical communication medium for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.  Despite its importance, effective interaction between sign language users and non-signers remains limited. This  project presents a real-time ASL recognition system using deep learning. The  system is designed to recognize both static and dynamic sign gestures.
